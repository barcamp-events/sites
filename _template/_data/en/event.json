			"BarCamp's are user generated conferences where the speakers are everyday folks, talking about what makes them excited. Talks aren’t scheduled or planned until just before the conference starts, and anyone can give a talk. Interested, but don’t want to give a talk? That’s okay too!",
			"At BarCamp, you won’t find a predetermined speaker list or a line of suits passing out business cards. What you will find is some shaggy dude in a t-shirt talking about moonshine, a web developer talking about the best practices in SEO, or a world traveler sharing their experiences. BarCamp is a chance to network, learn something new, and communicate what you’re most passionate about. Come one, come all."
