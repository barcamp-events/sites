      BarCamp is an Unconference
    {% endlargeh2 %}

    {% paragraph "f4-m" %}
      BarCamp Omaha is a user generated conference where the speakers are everyday folks talking about what interests them. Talks aren&rsquo;t scheduled or planned until just before the conference starts, and anyone can give a talk. Curious, but don&rsquo;t want to take the stage? That&rsquo;s okay, too.
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% paragraph "f4-m" %}
      At BarCamp, you won&rsquo;t find a predetermined speaker list or a line of suits passing out business cards. What you will find is some shaggy dude in a t-shirt talking about moonshine, a web developer talking about the best practices in SEO, or a world traveler sharing their experiences. BarCamp is a chance to network, learn something new, and share what awakens your curiosity. Come one, come all.

      FAQ&rsquo;s
    {% endh2 %}

    {% paragraph "f4-m" %}
      Got questions? We&rsquo;ve got answers!
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% h3 %}
      What am I paying $20 for?
    {% endh3 %}
    {% paragraph %}
      Opening party / drink ticket, breakfast, soda & snacks, lunch, BarCamp t-shirt, friendship bracelet, good times / new friends (which is sorta priceless&hellip;)
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% h3 %}
      How long are the talks?
    {% endh3 %}
    {% paragraph %}
      Each talk runs for 23 minutes. Speakers are allowed to use that time however they wish&mdash;you can even share a time slot with multiple people or set up a panel discussion, allowing time for Q&amp;A at the end. The last 7 minutes of every half-hour slot is reserved for transition time between talks.
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% h3 %}
      Can I give a sales presentation?
    {% endh3 %}
    {% paragraph %}
      Nope! To be respectful of our BarCamp community, sales presentations or pitches are not allowed. Donâ€™t even try it, folks.
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% h3 %}
      When do I get my BarCamp t-shirt?
    {% endh3 %}
    {% paragraph %}
      Tees and friendship bracelets will be available on the day of BarCamp at the merch table. Though we try to purchase enough of each t-shirt size, we recommend picking your shirt up early in the morning just in case.
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% h3 %}
      What should I bring?
    {% endh3 %}
    {% paragraph %}
      Something to share with all of your new friends&hellip;a business card perhaps? We encourage you to bring a notebook for notes. If you&rsquo;ve planned a talk with presentation slides, bring your laptop or an external drive with your files. And bring all your friends, because BarCamp is all about friendship this year!
    {% endparagraph %}

    {% h3 %}
      What if I have a food allergy?
    {% endh3 %}
    {% paragraph %}
      No sweat! We make sure everyone is included. If you have specific food allergies or restrictions, contact Will at <a href="mailto:will@splitinfinities.com">will@splitinfinities.com</a> and we&rsquo;ll take care of you. Each year we work with our caterer to provide vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options.
