      <h6 class="windsor black pa0 ma0 fs7" slot="label">How long are the talks?</h6>
      <p class="brown f6 lh-copy ma0 pa0 mw-100">
      Each talk runs for 23 minutes. Speakers are allowed to use that time however they wish&mdash;you can even share a time slot with multiple people or set up a panel discussion, allowing time for Q&amp;A at the end. The last 7 minutes of every half-hour slot is reserved for transition time between talks.

      <h6 class="windsor black pa0 ma0 fs7" slot="label">Can I give a sales presentation?</h6>
      <p class="brown f6 lh-copy ma0 pa0 mw-100">
        Nope! To be respectful of our BarCamp community, sales presentations or pitches are not allowed. Donâ€™t even try it, folks.

      <h6 class="windsor black pa0 ma0 fs7" slot="label">When do I get my BarCamp t-shirt?</h6>
      <p class="brown f6 lh-copy ma0 pa0 mw-100">
        Tees and friendship bracelets will be available on the day of BarCamp at the merch table. Though we try to purchase enough of each t-shirt size, we recommend picking your shirt up early in the morning just in case.

      <h6 class="windsor black pa0 ma0 fs7" slot="label">What should I bring?</h6>
      <p class="brown f6 lh-copy ma0 pa0 mw-100">
        Something to share with all of your new friends&hellip;a business card perhaps? We encourage you to bring a notebook for notes. If you&rsquo;ve planned a talk with presentation slides, bring your laptop or an external drive with your files. And bring all your friends, because BarCamp is all about friendship this year!

        No sweat! We make sure everyone is included. If you have specific food allergies or restrictions, contact Will at <a href="mailto:will@splitinfinities.com">will@splitinfinities.com</a> and we&rsquo;ll take care of you.
