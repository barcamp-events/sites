	"question": "How long are the talks?",
	"answer": "Each talk runs for 23 minutes. Speakers are allowed to use that time however they wish&mdash;you can even share a time slot with multiple people or set up a panel discussion, allowing time for Q&amp;A at the end. The last 7 minutes of every half-hour slot is reserved for transition time between talks."
