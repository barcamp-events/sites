      "At BarCamp, we’ve ditched the predetermined speaker list. We’re a user-generated, creative unconference that provides a space for everyday humans to share their passions. Talks aren’t scheduled until just before the conference starts, and anyone can speak — though it’s just as rewarding to sit back and listen. There’s no bar (except for drinks at the opening party) and no camp (unless you bring your own tent). But there’s a whole lot to discover."
